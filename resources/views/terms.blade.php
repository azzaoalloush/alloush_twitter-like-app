            Hi, this is Azza testing out the Twitter-like social media application for my midrerm exam :o. Fun fact, actually really really sad fact: this is my first time successfully creating a laravel project :3 I had many problems when trying to follow in class because my computer wasn't cooperating and I have yet to figure out how to fix the issues.
